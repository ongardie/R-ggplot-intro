Background
==========

This slide deck was created for a RAMCloud team meeting. RAMCloud is a
high-performance storage system developed at Stanford University. As in other
academic systems groups, the team mostly creates graphs to describe system
performance, and this slide deck covers all of the types of graphs typically
used for that purpose.

Nobody in attendance of the meeting was persuaded to switch to R and ggplot,
yet they seemed to appreciate learning more about that option without investing
much time. Remzi presented a new version of
[Zplot](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Zplot/) written in Python, but it's not
currently maintained as a public open-source project. The group agreed that
there did not seem to be an obvious winner among known plotting tools.
